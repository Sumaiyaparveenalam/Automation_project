**How to Use the Call Automation Program?**

This program allows you to automate phone calls using the adb (Android Debug Bridge) command-line tool. Once the script is compiled into an executable, follow these steps to use it effectively:

**Prerequisites**

*ADB Installed:*
Ensure that ADB is installed on your system and added to your system's PATH. You can download ADB as part of the Android SDK Platform Tools from the official Android developer site.

*Android Device:*
Your Android device should have USB debugging enabled. You can enable this in the Developer Options of your Android device.

*USB Connection:*
Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.

*Permissions:*
Make sure that you have granted the necessary permissions for ADB to interact with your device.

**Example Usage**

Run the executable torture.exe.

Enter your device ID when prompted (e.g., "0123456789abcdef").

Enter the phone number you want to dial (e.g., "+1234567890").

Enter the number of times to make the call (e.g., 5).
